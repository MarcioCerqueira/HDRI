This is a C++ application that projects the external lighting in Spherical Harmonics and factorizes it into a directional term.

In fact, I have implemented partially the algorithms proposed in two papers:
	An Efficient Representation for Irradiance Environment Maps - Ramamoorthi and Hanrahan (2001)
	Light Factorization for Mixed-Frequency Shadows in Augmented Reality - Nowrouzezahrai et al. (2011)
