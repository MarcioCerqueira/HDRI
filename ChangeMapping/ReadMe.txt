This is a C++ application to convert an environment map from/to angular, latitude-longitude and cube map spaces. 

Ideally, the angular map must have the same width and height.

The arguments can be seen inside the main.cpp. 

The application is a port of the MATLAB implementation provided in https://github.com/banterle/HDR_Toolbox/
