This is a C++ application to render a LDR image from a HDR image based on the tone mapping algorithm proposed by Reinhard. 

The application takes as argument an HDR image and the name of the output LDR image. The user can control 4 parameters to render the LDR image.

The algorithm is mainly based on the MATLAB implementation provided in https://github.com/banterle/HDR_Toolbox/
